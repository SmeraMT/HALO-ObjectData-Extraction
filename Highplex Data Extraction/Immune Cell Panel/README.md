This set of code is specifically for 4 cell markers named as Cy5_PanCK, Gold_CD19, Green#2_CD3 and NarrowRed_CD68. Object data .csv files obtained after highplex can be uploaded. The code generates an excel sheet with different kinds of data for each file uploaded. Data extracted depends on the filters used. 
Data extraction code takes in highplex object data file and extracts percentage of each cell type defined as positive for a marker with respect to all cells in the tissue in the region defined. This is done for three classifier regions in the given code - whole tissue(no classifier label), tumour and stroma.
QC Type 1 takes in highplex object data file and gives percentage of cells which are positive for multiple markers used, with respect to all cells in the tissue.
QC Type 2 takes in highplex object data file and gives percentage of multi-marker positive cells with respect to all cells positive for a particular marker. For example, for marker Cy5_PanCK, it calculates all combinations of Cy5_PanCK with other markers present and takes percentage with all cells positive for Cy5_PanCK regardless of any other marker. 
Spatial plot uses highplex object data file and gives an html which shows a scatter plot with positional information (x, y coordinates) of all single positive cells based on different markers.
